# St. Patrick's Live Stream

This is a simple GUI to assist in the live streaming of masses from St. Patrick's Parish in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. 

This GUI allows for easy control of the movement of an Arducam 13MP Pan Tilt Zoom PTZ Camera connected through a Raspberry Pi 4 Module B. It has numerous presets for the camera to move to various standard positions.

This GUI is currently still in development with expected deployment in early 2021. 

To use this GUI users must have PyQt5 and Python 3.8 downloaded and installed on their work stations.
